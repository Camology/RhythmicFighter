# RhythmicFighter
2D Fighter game based on rhythms, each character has their own musical track (maybe more)? And if actions are performed in time
to the music there are bonuses such as higher damage or different status effects. The stage morphs between the two tracks
or will perform some sort of mashup between the two. Stages can also have a portion of the track so there are 3 different layers
of complexity to these tracks.
